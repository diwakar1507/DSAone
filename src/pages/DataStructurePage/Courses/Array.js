            <p>
              <span className="text-xl">A</span>n array is a collection of items
              stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store
              multiple items of the same type together.We can think of an array
              as a fleet of stairs where on each step is placed a value (let’s
              say one of your friends). Here, you can identify the location of
              any of your friends by simply knowing the count of the step they
              are on.
              <br /> Remember: “Location of next index depends on the data type
              we use”.
              <br />
              <br /> This makes it easier to calculate the position of each
              element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the
              memory location of the first element of the array (generally
              denoted by the name of the array). The base value is index 0 and
              the difference between the two indexes is the offset.
              <br />
              Types of indexing in an array:
              <br /> &emsp;&emsp;0 (zero-based indexing): The first element of
              the array is indexed by a subscript of 0.
              <br /> &emsp;&emsp;1 (one-based indexing): The first element of
              the array is indexed by the subscript of 1.
              <br /> &emsp;&emsp;n (n-based indexing): The base index of an
              array can be freely chosen.

              Following are the basic operations supported by an array.
              <br /> &emsp;&emsp;<strong>Traverse</strong> − print all the array
              elements one by one.
              <br /> &emsp;&emsp; <strong>Insertion</strong> − Adds an element
              at the given index.
              <br /> &emsp;&emsp; <strong>Deletion</strong> − Deletes an element
              at the given index.
              <br /> &emsp;&emsp; <strong>Search</strong> − Searches an element
              using the given index or by the value.
              <br /> &emsp;&emsp; <strong>Update</strong> − Updates an element
              at the given index.

              Advantages Of Array
            </h1>
            <p>
              &emsp;1. Arrays represent multiple data items of the same type
              using a single name.
              <br />
              &emsp;2. In arrays, the elements can be accessed randomly by using
              the index number.
              <br />
              &emsp;3. Arrays allocate memory in contiguous memory locations for
              all its elements.
              <br />
              &emsp;&emsp;Hence there is no chance of extra memory being
              allocated in case of arrays.
              <br />
              &emsp;&emsp;This avoids memory overflow or shortage of memory in
              arrays.
              <br />
              &emsp;4. Using arrays, other data structures like linked lists,
              stacks, queues, trees, graphs etc can be implemented.
              <br />
              &emsp;5. Two-dimensional arrays are used to represent matrices.
              <br />
              &emsp;6. Maintains multiple variable names using a single name.

              Disadvantages Of Array
            </h1>
            <p>
              &emsp;1. The number of elements to be stored in an array should be
              known in advance.
              <br />
              &emsp;2. An array is a static structure (which means the array is
              of fixed size).
              <br />
              &emsp;3. Insertion and deletion are quite difficult in an array as
              shifting operation is costly.
              <br />
              &emsp;4. Allocating more memory than the requirement leads to
              wastage of memory space.
