            A tree is a data structure similar to a linked list but instead of
            each node pointing simply to the next node in a linear fashion, each
            node points to a number of nodes. Tree is an example of a nonlinear
            data structure. A tree structure is a way of representing the
            hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form.
            <br />
            <br />
            In trees ADT (Abstract Data Type), the order of the elements is not
            important. If we need ordering information, linear data structures
            like linked lists, stacks, queues, etc. can be used.

            Before defining the complete binary tree, let us assume that the
            height of the binary tree is h. In complete binary trees, if we give
            numbering for the nodes by starting at the root (let us say the root
            node has 1) then we get a complete sequence from 1 to the number of
            nodes in the tree. While traversing we should give numbering for
            NULL pointers also. A binary tree is called complete binary tree if
            all leaf nodes are at height h or h – 1 and also without any missing
            number in the sequence.
            <br />
            <br />
            A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels are
            completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled
            from the left. A complete binary tree is just like a full binary
            tree, but with two major differences

            In order to process trees, we need a mechanism for traversing them,
            and that forms the subject of this section. The process of visiting
            all nodes of a tree is called tree traversal. Each node is processed
            only once but it may be visited more than once. As we have already
            seen in linear data structures (like linked lists, stacks, queues,
            etc.), the elements are visited in sequential order. But, in tree
            structures there are many different ways.
            <br />
            <br />
            Tree traversal is like searching the tree, except that in traversal
            the goal is to move through the tree in a particular order. In
            addition, all nodes are processed in the traversal but searching
            stops when the required node is found.

            There is another traversal method which does not depend on the above
            orders and it is:
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>
              Level Order Traversal: This method is inspired from Breadth First

            <strong className="text-yellow-100 text-3xl">
              Preorder Traversal
            </strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            In preorder traversal, each node is processed before (pre) either of
            its subtrees. This is the simplest traversal to understand. However,
            even though each node is processed before the subtrees, it still
            requires that some information must be maintained while moving down
            the tree. In the example above, 1 is processed first, then the left
            subtree, and this is followed by the right subtree.
            <br />
            <br />
            Therefore, processing must return to the right subtree after
            finishing the processing of the left subtree. To move to the right
            subtree after processing the left subtree, we must maintain the root
            information. The obvious ADT for such information is a stack.
            Because of its LIFO structure, it is possible to get the information
            about the right subtrees back in the reverse order. Preorder
            traversal is defined as follows: <br />
            <br />
            <li>Visit the root.</li>
            <li>Traverse the left subtree in Preorder.</li>
