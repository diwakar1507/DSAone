      <br />
      <br />
      Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a
      subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. A single
      graph can have many different spanning trees. A minimum spanning tree
      (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected,
      undirected graph is a spanning tree with a weight less than or equal to
      the weight of every other spanning tree. The weight of a spanning tree is
      the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.
      <br />
      <br /> How many edges does a minimum spanning tree has?
      <br />A minimum spanning tree has (V â€“ 1) edges where V is the number of
      vertices in the given graph.

        Prims Algorithm
      </div>
      Prim's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph
      as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph which
      <li>form a tree that includes every vertex</li>
      <li>
        has the minimum sum of weights among all the trees that can be formed
        from the graph
      </li>

        How Prim's algorithm works
      </div>
      It falls under a class of algorithms called greedy algorithms that find
      the local optimum in the hopes of finding a global optimum.
      <br /> <br />
      We start from one vertex and keep adding edges with the lowest weight
      until we reach our goal.
      <br /> <br />
      The steps for implementing Prim's algorithm are as follows:
      <div className="pl-5 py-2">
        <li>
          Initialize the minimum spanning tree with a vertex chosen at random.
        </li>
        <li>
          Find all the edges that connect the tree to new vertices, find the
          minimum and add it to the tree
        </li>
        <li>Keep repeating step 2 until we get a minimum spanning tree</li>
      </div>

        Prim's Algorithm Complexity
      </div>
      The time complexity of Prim's algorithm is O(E log V).
