        Binary Search
      </div>
      This type of searching algorithm is used to find the position of a
      specific value contained in a sorted array. The binary search algorithm
      works on the principle of divide and conquer and it is considered the best
      searching algorithm because it's faster to run.
      <br />
      Now let's take a sorted array as an example and try to understand how it
      works:
      <br />
      arr = [2, 12, 15, 17, 27, 29, 45]
      <br />
      Suppose the target element to be searched is 17.
      <br />
      <div className="text-2xl py-5 text-yellow-100">
        Approach for Binary Search
      </div>
      <li>Compare the target element with the middle element of the array.</li>
      <li>
        If the target element is greater than the middle element, then the
        search continues in the right half.
      </li>
      <li>
        Else if the target element is less than the middle value, the search
        continues in the left half.
      </li>
      <li>
        This process is repeated until the middle element is equal to the target
        element, or the target element is not in the array
      </li>
      <li>
        If the target element is found, its index is returned, else -1 is
        returned.
      </li>

        Time Complexity Analysis
      </div>
      <li>
        <strong>The Best Case </strong>occurs when the target element is the
        middle element of the array. The number of comparisons, in this case, is
        1. So, the time complexity is O(1).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Average Case:</strong>On average, the target element will be
        somewhere in the array. So, the time complexity will be O(logN).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Worst Case</strong>occurs when the target element is not in
        the list or it is away from the middle element. So, the time complexity
        will be O(logN).
