        Insertion sort is the sorting mechanism where the sorted array is built
        having one item at a time. The array elements are compared with each
        other sequentially and then arranged simultaneously in some particular
        order. The analogy can be understood from the style we arrange a deck of
        cards. This sort works on the principle of inserting an element at a
        particular position, hence the name Insertion Sort.

          The first step involves the comparison of the element in question with
          its adjacent element.
        </li>
        <li>
          And if at every comparison reveals that the element in question can be
          inserted at a particular position, then space is created for it by
          shifting the other elements one position to the right and inserting
          the element at the suitable position.
        </li>
        <li>
          The above procedure is repeated until all the element in the array is
          at their apt position.
        </li>
      </div>
      Let us now understand working with the following example:
      <br />
      Consider the following array: 25, 17, 31, 13, 2<br />
      First Iteration: Compare 25 with 17. The comparison shows 17{"<"} 25.
      Hence swap 17 and 25.
      <br />
      The array now looks like : 17, 25, 31, 13, 2
      <img className="h-32 m-5 " src={one} />
      <br />
      Second Iteration: Begin with the second element (25), but it was already
      swapped on for the correct position, so we move ahead to the next element.
      <br />
      Now hold on to the third element (31) and compare with the ones preceding
      it . Since 31{">"} 25, no swapping takes place. Also, 31{">"}17, no
      swapping takes place and 31 remains at its position.
      <br />
      The array after the Second iteration looks like: 17, 25, 31, 13, 2
      <img className="h-24 m-5 " src={two} />
      Third Iteration: Start the following Iteration with the fourth element
      (13), and compare it with its preceding elements. Since 13{"<"} 31, we
      swap the two.
      <br />
      Array now becomes: 17, 25, 13, 31, 2.
      <br />
      But there still exist elements that we havenâ€™t yet compared with 13. Now
      the comparison takes place between 25 and 13. Since, 13 {"<"} 25, we swap
      the two.
      <br />
      The array becomes 17, 13, 25, 31, 2.
      <br />
      The last comparison for the iteration is now between 17 and 13. Since 13
      {"<"} 17, we swap the two.
      <br />
      The array now becomes 13, 17, 25, 31, 2.
      <img className="h-24 m-5 " src={three} />
      Fourth Iteration: The last iteration calls for the comparison of the last
      element (2), with all the preceding elements and make the appropriate
      swapping between elements. Since, 2{"<"} 31. Swap 2 and 31.
      <br />
      Array now becomes: 13, 17, 25, 2, 31.
      <br />
      Compare 2 with 25, 17, 13 . Since, 2{"<"} 25. Swap 25 and 2.
      <br />
      13, 17, 2, 25, 31.
      <br />
      Compare 2 with 17 and 13.Since, 2{"<"}17. Swap 2 and 17.
      <br />
      Array now becomes: 13, 2, 17, 25, 31.
      <br />
      The last comparison for the Iteration is to compare 2 with 13 . Since 2
      {"<"} 13. Swap 2 and 13.
      <br />
      The array now becomes: 2, 13, 17, 25, 31.
      <br />
      This is the final array after all the corresponding iterations and
      swapping of elements.

        Time Complexity Analysis:
      </div>
      Even though insertion sort is efficient, still, if we provide an already
      sorted array to the insertion sort algorithm, it will still execute the
      outer for loop, thereby requiring n steps to sort an already sorted array
      of n elements, which makes its best case time complexity a linear function
      of n.
      <br />
      <br />
      Wherein for an unsorted array, it takes for an element to compare with all
      the other elements which mean every n element compared with all other n
      elements. Thus, making it for n x n, i.e., n2 comparisons. One can also
      take a look at other sorting algorithms such as Merge sort, Quick Sort,
      Selection Sort, etc. and understand their complexities.
