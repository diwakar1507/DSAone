        Merge Sort
      </div>
      Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It works on
      the principle of Divide and Conquer. Merge sort repeatedly breaks down a
      list into several sublists until each sublist consists of a single element
      and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list.
      <div className="text-3xl py-5 text-yellow-100">
        A merge sort works as follows:
      </div>
      <div className="text-2xl py-5 text-yellow-100">
        Top-down Merge Sort Implementation:
      </div>
      The top-down merge sort approach is the methodology which uses recursion
      mechanism. It starts at the Top and proceeds downwards, with each
      recursive turn asking the same question such as “What is required to be
      done to sort the array?” and having the answer as, “split the array into
      two, make a recursive call, and merge the results.”, until one gets to the
      bottom of the array-tree.
      <br />
      Example: Let us consider an example to understand the approach better.
      <li>
        Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each comprising 1 element (a
        list of 1 element is supposed sorted).
      </li>
      <img className="h-screen m-10" src={one} />
      <li>
        Repeatedly merge sublists to produce newly sorted sublists until there
        is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
      </li>
      <div className="text-2xl py-5 text-yellow-100">
        Merging of two lists done as follows:
      </div>
      The first element of both lists is compared. If sorting in ascending
      order, the smaller element among two becomes a new element of the sorted
      list. This procedure is repeated until both the smaller sublists are empty
      and the newly combined sublist covers all the elements of both the
      sublists.
      <img className="h-screen m-10" src={two} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Merge;
